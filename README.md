# incon - Computational Models of Instantaneous Consonance

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

`incon` is an R package that implements various computational models of
instantaneous consonance perception.

## Authors

This package, and the supporting packages listed in *Packages*, were
created by Peter M. C. Harrison as part of a research project supervised
by Marcus T. Pearce and Emmanouil Benetos.

## Installation

You can install the current version of `incon` from Github by entering
the following commands into R:

``` r
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("incon")
```

## Usage

The primary function is `incon`, which applies consonance models to an
input chord. The default model is that of Hutchinson & Knopoff (1978):

    #> hutch_78_roughness 
    #>          0.1202426

You can specify a vector of models and these will applied in turn.

    #> hutch_78_roughness       parn_94_pure    huron_94_dyadic 
    #>          0.1300830          0.6368813          2.2200000

See *Models* for a list of available models. See the packageâ€™s inbuilt
documentation, `?incon`, for further details.

## Models

Currently the following models are
implemented:
